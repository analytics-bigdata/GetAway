# GetAway

[Demo Page](https://mbelgrader.github.io/getaway/)

While the market is already saturated with airline booking applications, the majority of them focus on either booking a specific flight, or finding the lowest-priced flight available for a certain time period. However there is a growing section of users who search for flights leaving immediately, with less regard for price or date. GetAway fills this niche for spontaneous users, who want a destination-agnostic, moderately priced international flight that leaves as soon as possible.


## Implementation

GetAway is a mobile app build with React native that allows a user to find spontaneous round trip airfare to locations around the world.
